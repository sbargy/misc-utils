# mac-utils
Utilities I use on Mac OSX

*   caff - calls caffeinate to keep system awake
*   nametab - bash script to explicitly name a tab in iTerm
*   listenv - Python code to display environment variables in a beautifully formatted manner.  Takes an argument, i.e. "listenv HIST" only shows env vars that contain the text "HIST". Written by Dan Auerbach
*   process-prime.sh - make a list of movies and copy that list to the web site
